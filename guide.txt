4.order
Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).
positive number moves item to right.
Negative number moves item to left.

5.align-self
align-self property, accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.
